DRAFT W3C IPR Policy, based on WHATWG IPR Policy</h1>
	<p>
	<em>Status of this document:</em>
	This is a discussion draft with no official status.
	Derived from <a href="https://whatwg.org/ipr-policy">WHATWG IPR Policy</a>

	<p>
	This W3C Intelectual Property Rights Policy
	("<a href="#">W3C IPR Policy</a>")
	applies to all <a href="#21-contribution">Contributions</a> to W3C Specifications,
	and governs the intellectual property obligations
	of all <a href="#contributor">Contributors</a> to W3C Specifications
	and <a href="#wgparticipant">Working Group Participants</a>.

	<p>
	To the extent any other policies,
	conflict with this <a href="#">W3C IPR Policy</a>,

	<p>
	All <a href="#contributor">Contributors</a> make commitments regarding copyrights;

	regarding <a href="#22-essential-patent-claims">Essential Patent Claims</a>

1.2. Licensing Goals for W3C Specifications<a class="self-link" href="#11-goals"></a></h3>

	<p>
	In order to promote the widest adoption of Web standards,
	W3C seeks to issue W3C Specifications
	that can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis.
	Subject to the conditions of this policy,
	W3C will not @@permit work to proceed?@@
	if it is aware that Essential Patent Claims exist
	which are not available on Royalty-Free terms.

	<p>
	To this end,
	Working Group charters
	will include a reference to this W3C IPR Policy
	and a requirement that specifications produced by the Working Group will be implementable on an RF basis,
	to the best ability of the Working Group and the Consortium.

<h2><a id="sec-PAG-formation" name="sec-PAG-formation">
5.5.5.1. PAG Formation</a></h2>

	<p>
	In the event a patent has been disclosed that may be essential,
	but is not available under <a href="#def-RF">W3C RF licensing requirements</a>,
	a Patent Advisory Group (PAG) will be launched to resolve the conflict.
	The PAG is an ad-hoc group constituted specifically
	in relation to the Working Group with the conflict.
	A PAG may also be formed without such a disclosure
	if a PAG could help avoid anticipated patent problems.
	During the time that the PAG is operating,
	the Working Group may continue its technical work
	within the bounds of its charter.

<h2><a id="sec-PAG-composition" name="sec-PAG-composition">
5.5.5.2 PAG Composition</a></h2>

	<p>The PAG is composed of:

	<ul>
		<li>
			Advisory Committee Representatives of each W3C Member organization
			participating in the Working Group
			(or alternate designated by the AC Rep)

		<li>
			Working Group Team Contact

		<li>
			W3C Counsel

		<li>
			Working Group Chair, <em>ex officio</em>

		<li>
			Others suggested by the Working Group Chair
			and/or the Team with the approval of the Director
	</ul>

	<p>
	W3C Member participants in the PAG
	should be authorized to represent their organization's views on patent licensing issues.
	Any participant in the PAG may also be represented by legal counsel,
	though this is not required.
	Invited experts are not entitled to participate in the PAG,
	though the PAG may chose to invite any qualified experts who
	would be able to assist the PAG in its determinations.

	<p>
	W3C expects to provide qualified legal staffing to all PAGs
	in the form of a Team member who develops experience with the PAG process
	and patent issues at W3C.
	Legal staff to the PAG will represent the interests of the Consortium as a whole.

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-procedures-timing" name="sec-PAG-procedures-timing">
5.5.5.3.1. PAG Formation Timing</a></h3>

	<p>
	The PAG will be convened by the Working Group Team Contact,
	based on a charter developed initially by the Team.
	The timing for convening the PAG is at the discretion of the Director,
	based on consultation with the Chair of the Working Group.

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-procedures-charter" name="sec-PAG-procedures-charter">
5.5.5.3.2. PAG Charter Requirements</a></h3>

	<p>
	The charter should include:

	<ul>
		<li>
			clear goals for the PAG,
			especially a statement of the question(s) the PAG is to answer.

		<li>
			duration.

		<li>
			confidentiality status,
			which must follow the underlying Working Group
			(Member only, public, etc.).
	</ul>

	<p>
	The PAG charter must specify deadlines
	for completion of individual work items it takes on.
	The PAG,
	once convened,
	may propose changes to its charter as appropriate,
	to be accepted based on consensus of the PAG participants.
	The Team will choose a member of the PAG
	to serve as Chair.
	A single PAG may exist for the duration of the Working Group
	with which it is associated
	if needed.

	<p>
	In order to obtain input from the interested public at large,
	as soon as the PAG is convened,
	the PAG charter will be made public,
	along with all of the patent disclosure
	and licensing statements applicable
	to the Working Group in question.

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-conclude-possible" name="sec-PAG-conclude-possible">
5.5.5.4.1. Possible PAG Conclusions</a></h3>

	<p>
	After appropriate consultation, the PAG may conclude:

	<ol>
		<li>
			The initial concern has been resolved,
			enabling the Working Group to continue.

		<li>
			The Working Group should be instructed
			to consider designing around the identified claims.

		<li>
			The Team should seek further information and evaluation,
			including and not limited to evaluation of the patents in question
			or the terms under which W3C RF licensing requirements may be met.

		<li>
			The Working Group should be terminated.

		<li>
			The W3C Specification should be rescinded.

		<li>
			Alternative licensing terms should be considered.
			The procedure in section 5.5.5.4.3 must be followed.
	</ol>

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-conclude-outcome" name="sec-PAG-conclude-outcome">
5.5.5.4.2 PAG Outcome</a></h3>

	<p>
	Outcomes 4, 5 or 6
	require an Advisory Committee Review and Director's decision.
	In any case,
	the PAG must state its proposal and reasons in a public W3C document.

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-conclude-alternate" name="sec-PAG-conclude-alternate">
5.5.5.4.3. Procedure for Considering Alternate Licensing Terms</a></h3>

	<p>
	After having made every effort to resolve the conflict
	through options 1, 2, and 3 under 7.5.1,
       the PAG, by <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">consensus</a>
       [<cite><a href="#ref-PROCESS">PROCESS</a></cite>, section 3.3],
       may propose that specifically identified patented technology
       be included in the Recommendation
       even though such claims are not available
       according to the W3C RF licensing requirements of this policy ("PAG Proposal").
       The PAG Proposal must explain:

	<ul>
		<li>
			why the chartered goals of the Working Group cannot be met
			without inclusion of the identified technology;

		<li>
			how the proposed licensing terms
			will be consistent with widespread adoption.
	</ul>

	<p>The PAG Proposal must include:

	<ul>
		<li>
			a complete list of claims and licensing terms
			of the proposed alternative arrangements;
			and,

		<li>
			a proposed charter for the Working Group,
			unless the Recommendation has been issued and no new work is required.
	</ul>

	<p>
	If the Director determines that the PAG Proposal
	is the best alternative consistent with the W3C mission,
	the interests of the Web community,
	and is clearly justified despite the expressed preference of the W3C Membership for RF licensing,
	then the PAG Proposal shall be circulated for public comment
	and Advisory Committee review.
	The Director may also circulate the PAG Proposal for Advisory Committee review without such endorsement.
	Should the PAG Proposal be rejected,
	then either sub-paragraph 4 or 5 of section 7.5.3 will apply as appropriate,
	without further action of the Advisory Committee.
	Members of the Working Group who are bound to RF terms
	are not released from their obligations by virtue of the PAG Proposal alone.
	As with any newly chartered Working Group,
	new commitments must be made,
	along with possible exclusions.
	In order to expedite the process,
	the PAG Proposal should consider whether additional claims would be excluded
	under the new charter and include such information in the PAG Proposal.
