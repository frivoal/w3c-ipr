<h1>DRAFT Evergreen Patent Policy, based on WHATWG IPR Policy</h1>
<p><em>Status of this document:</em> This is a discussion draft with no official status. Derived from <a href="https://whatwg.org/ipr-policy">WHATWG IPR Policy</a></p>

<p>This Evergreen Patent Policy ("<a href="#">Evergreen Patent Policy</a>") applies to all <a href="#21-contribution">Contributions</a> to Evergreen Specifications, and governs the intellectual property obligations of all <a href="#contributor">Contributors</a> to Evergreen Specifications and <a href="#evergreenparticipant">Evergreen Participants</a>.</p>
<p>To the extent any other policies, conflict with this <a href="#">Evergreen Patent Policy</a>, the <a href="#">Evergreen Patent Policy</a> controls.</p>

<h4 id="11-purpose">1.1. Purpose<a class="self-link" href="#11-purpose"></a></h4>

<p>All <a href="#contributor">Contributors</a> make commitments regarding copyrights; all <a href="#contributor">Contributors</a> make additional patent-licensing commitments regarding <a href="#22-essential-patent-claims">Essential Patent Claims</a> on <a href="#21-contribution">Contributions</a>; <a href="#evergreenparticipant">Evergreen Participants</a> make additional patent-licensing commitments regarding <a href="#review-draft">Review Drafts</a>.</p>
  
<h4 id="12-goals">1.2. Licensing Goals for Evergreen Specifications<a class="self-link" href="#11-goals"></a></h4>
<p>In order to promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Evergreen Specifications that can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis. Subject to the conditions of this policy, W3C will not @@permit work to proceed?@@ if it is aware that Essential Patent Claims exist which are not available on Royalty-Free terms.
</p><p>
To this end, Working Group charters that encompass Evergreen work will include a reference to this Evergreen Patent Policy and a requirement that specifications produced by the Working Group will be implementable on an RF basis, to the best ability of the Working Group and the Consortium.</p>

In the event of an exclusion of an Essential Patent Claim, a Patent Advisory Group (PAG) will be formed as described below. <!--@@ <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Exception">W3C Patent Policy, Exception Handling</a>. PAG -->

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-formation" name="sec-PAG-formation">5.5.5.1. PAG
Formation</a></h3>

<p>In the event a patent has been disclosed that may be essential, but
is not available under <a href="#def-RF">W3C RF licensing
requirements</a>, a Patent Advisory Group (PAG) will be launched to
resolve the conflict. The PAG is an ad-hoc group constituted
specifically in relation to the Working Group with the conflict. A PAG
may also be formed without such a disclosure if a PAG could help avoid
anticipated patent problems. During the time that the PAG is operating,
the Working Group may continue its technical work within the bounds of
its charter.</p>

<h3><a id="sec-PAG-composition" name="sec-PAG-composition">5.5.5.2 PAG
Composition</a></h3>

<p>The PAG is composed of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advisory Committee Representatives of each W3C Member organization
participating in the Working Group (or alternate designated by the AC
Rep)</li>

<li>Working Group Team Contact</li>

<li>W3C Counsel</li>

<li>Working Group Chair, <em>ex officio</em></li>

<li>Others suggested by the Working Group Chair and/or the Team with
the approval of the Director</li>
</ul>

<p>W3C Member participants in the PAG should be authorized to represent
their organization's views on patent licensing issues. Any participant
in the PAG may also be represented by legal counsel, though this is not
required. Invited experts are not entitled to participate in the PAG,
though the PAG may chose to invite any qualified experts who would be
able to assist the PAG in its determinations.</p>

<p>W3C expects to provide qualified legal staffing to all PAGs in the
form of a Team member who develops experience with the PAG process and
patent issues at W3C. Legal staff to the PAG will represent the
interests of the Consortium as a whole.</p>

Procedures</a></h3>

<h4><a id="sec-PAG-procedures-timing"

<p>The PAG will be convened by the Working Group Team Contact, based on
a charter developed initially by the Team. The timing for convening the
PAG is at the discretion of the Director, based on consultation with
the Chair of the Working Group.</p>

<h4><a id="sec-PAG-procedures-charter"
name="sec-PAG-procedures-charter">5.5.5.3.2. PAG Charter
Requirements</a></h4>

<p>The charter should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear goals for the PAG, especially a statement of the question(s)
the PAG is to answer.</li>

<li>duration.</li>

<li>confidentiality status, which must follow the underlying Working
Group (Member only, public, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>The PAG charter must specify deadlines for completion of individual
work items it takes on. The PAG, once convened, may propose changes to
its charter as appropriate, to be accepted based on consensus of the
PAG participants. The Team will choose a member of the PAG to serve as
Chair. A single PAG may exist for the duration of the Working Group
with which it is associated if needed.</p>

<p>In order to obtain input from the interested public at large, as
soon as the PAG is convened, the PAG charter will be made public, along
with all of the patent disclosure and licensing statements applicable
to the Working Group in question.</p>

Conclusion</a></h3>

<h4><a id="sec-PAG-conclude-possible"
name="sec-PAG-conclude-possible">5.5.5.4.1. Possible PAG
Conclusions</a></h4>

<p>After appropriate consultation, the PAG may conclude:</p>

<ol>
<li>The initial concern has been resolved, enabling the Working Group
to continue.</li>

<li>The Working Group should be instructed to consider designing around
the identified claims.</li>

<li>The Team should seek further information and evaluation, including
and not limited to evaluation of the patents in question or the terms
under which W3C RF licensing requirements may be met.</li>

<li>The Working Group should be terminated.</li>

<li>The Evergreen Specification should be
rescinded.</li>

<li>Alternative licensing terms should be considered. The procedure in
section 5.5.5.4.3 must be followed.</li>

<h4><a id="sec-PAG-conclude-outcome"
name="sec-PAG-conclude-outcome"> 5.5.5.4.2 PAG Outcome</a></h4>

<p>Outcomes 4, 5 or 6 require an Advisory Committee review and
Director's decision. In any case, the PAG must state its proposal and
reasons in a public W3C document.</p>

<h4><a id="sec-PAG-conclude-alternate"
name="sec-PAG-conclude-alternate"> 5.5.5.4.3. Procedure for Considering
Alternate Licensing Terms</a></h4>

<p>After having made every effort to resolve the conflict through
options 1, 2, and 3 under 7.5.1, the PAG, by <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">consensus</a>
[<cite><a href="#ref-PROCESS">PROCESS</a></cite>, section 3.3], may
propose that specifically identified patented technology be included in
the Recommendation even though such claims are not available according
to the W3C RF licensing requirements of this policy ("PAG Proposal"). The PAG Proposal
must explain:</p>

<ul>
<li>why the chartered goals of the Working Group cannot be met without
inclusion of the identified technology;</li>

<li>how the proposed licensing terms will be consistent with widespread
adoption.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PAG Proposal must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a complete list of claims and licensing terms of the proposed
alternative arrangements; and,</li>

<li>a proposed charter for the Working Group, unless the Recommendation
has been issued and no new work is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Director determines that the PAG Proposal is the best
alternative consistent with the W3C mission, the interests of the Web
community, and is clearly justified despite the expressed preference of
the W3C Membership for RF licensing, then the PAG Proposal shall be
circulated for public comment and Advisory Committee review. The
Director may also circulate the PAG Proposal for Advisory Committee review
without such endorsement. Should the PAG Proposal be rejected, then
either sub-paragraph 4 or 5 of section 7.5.3 will apply as appropriate,
without further action of the Advisory Committee. Members of the
Working Group who are bound to RF terms are not released from their
obligations by virtue of the PAG Proposal alone. As with any newly
chartered Working Group, new commitments must be made, along with
possible exclusions. In order to expedite the process, the PAG Proposal
should consider whether additional claims would be excluded under the
new charter and include such information in the PAG Proposal.</p>
